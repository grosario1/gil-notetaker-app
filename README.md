## Installation
The ReadMe was generated using code from the inquirer node js package including some custom code to help add the contents and autogenerate a professional looking ReadMe file. You can review the code within the index.js as well as the code from utils/generateMarkdown.js to reference how the ReadMe gets generated. First you should clone this repo (git repo https://github.com/grosario1/gr-SVG_Logo_Maker.git). Once you clode the repo, change directories to go into the Develop folder, from here you can modify the index.js to add or update the input prompts which are rendered by the use of the inquirer node js package. You will need to ensure you install the node.js and npm utility in order for you utilize this readme generator. You can follow the instructions to install the utility from here: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm. Once, it is install, use the cmd to navigate to the repo you just cloned and run.... `node init -y` to initized the node js project, then install the inquirer 8.2.4 node js package by running `npm i inquirer@8.2.4.` After, making your changes to the index.js file, you can then run `node index.js` from the command line and then you will now be prompted to input the contents of the ReadMe.
